						<abstract class="metaReview">A modernization project that brought enhanced user experience and OpenAPI to an immensely complex back-office portal application. Multiple clients and users are allowed to manage 20+ large sub-systems including Scheduling, Inventory, Reporting, Transactions, and various object profiles. Each feature involves shared business rules, integrations, and dependencies on other systems and external, out-of-band data. Work done in the Portal is pushed to thousands of portable POS devices that then return data - both synchronously and asynchronously - back to the Portal for processing.<br/>
						My role on this project involved managing internal and client BAs to produce all BA deliverables. The scope and ambition of the project demanded thorough analysis and a multitude of concurrent work streams. To stabilize the complexity, I co-lead discovery meetings with the Architect to map functional and system dependencies previously unidentified. The outcome realigned the entire team, focusing efforts on foundational features and allowing important architectural decisions to be made quickly. I also introduced documentation and tools for the BA and UX teams to utilize, allowing successful delivery of the many work streams. As an individual I delivered and reviewed functional spec documents, wireframes, and BA team status. I worked extremely closely with the Architect, Leads and the development team to advise and lead meetings with the Product Owner on technical solutions and appropriate user experience.</abstract>

						<abstract>PA is a complex enterprise application inherited by Saggezza from another consulting team at RR Donnelley. It is a multi-client tool that allows robust content management and document customization. I joined as the application was converted to handle multiple clients and our second and third clients were on-boarded. These efforts exposed large technical debts as well as the need for major feature enhancements.</abstract>
						<ul class="list-job">
							<li>Quickly ramped up as a SME leading client training and requirement gathering after the first month.</li>
							<li>Built strong relationships with the technical leads to understand the limitations and inefficiencies of the current architecture. This resulted in a backlog of technical debt that could be smartly targeted alongside incoming feature enhancements.</li>
							<li>Served as the primary contact for our newest customer who used the application in a completely new way. Their evolving needs were captured and analyzed in the context of product improvements. I incorporated my knowledge of their business, the product’s long term vision, and user experience to drive the planning and successful delivery of enhancements.</li>
							<li>Aided the new QA Lead’s testing of large sets of business rules by reformatting the existing documentation and building dynamic test management documents in Google Drive. These synced development and QA efforts by making requirements clear and progress visible.</li>
							<li>Designed, implemented, and introduced new JIRA workflows to client, onshore, and offshore teams</li>
