						<h5>Configuration Portal for Passenger Services</h5>
						<role>BA Team Lead, Senior Business Analyst</role>
						<dates>
							<from>Jun</from>
							<to>Dec 2014</to>
						</dates>
						<p class="abstract">A modernization project that brought enhanced user experience and OpenAPI to an immensely complex back-office portal application. Multiple clients and users are allowed to manage 20+ large sub-systems including Scheduling, Inventory, Reporting, Transactions, and various object profiles. Each feature involves shared business rules, integrations, and dependencies on other systems and external, out-of-band data. Work done in the Portal is pushed to thousands of portable POS devices that then return data - both synchronously and asynchronously - back to the Portal for processing.
						</p><p class="abstract">
						I joined the project mid-way through to help speed up API requirements. I quickly inherited the role of BA and UX manager as well as primary driver of overall requirements and design.	The scope and ambition of the project demanded thorough analysis and a multitude of concurrent work streams.</p>
						<ul class="list-job">
							<li>Stabilized project by co-leading discovery meetings with the Architect to map functional and system dependencies.</li>
							<explanation>The team felt disenfranchised and were left with the feeling that their concerns and suggestions were second tier. I was able to encourage their activity by involving them earlier in challenging requirements and bringing their input to senior team members making decisions. Ultimately, this led to more interactions and adhoc discussions throughout the team and, thus, improved sprints</explanation></li>
							<li>Managed internal and client BAs as well as an offshore Interaction Designer; elevated the team's ability to estimate, track, and complete work by introducing Trello</li>
							<li>Increased Requirements output and quality by introducing an API Functional Spec template based on developer feedback. <explanation>Having addressed the needs of the entire team, the template emphasised completeness and clarity. This centralised the information available to the team which in turn reduced the time spent in meetings and answering isolated questions.</explanation></li>
