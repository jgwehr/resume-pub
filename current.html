						<h5 class="project">Portal for Passenger Services</h5>
						<role>BA Team Lead, Sr BA</role>
						<dates>
							<from>Jun</from>
							<to>Dec 2014</to>
						</dates>
						<p class="abstract">A modernization project that brought enhanced user experience and OpenAPI to an immensely complex back-office portal application. Multiple clients and users are allowed to manage 20+ large sub-systems including Scheduling, Inventory, Reporting, Transactions, and various object profiles. Each feature involves shared business rules, integrations, and dependencies on other systems and external, out-of-band data. Work done in the Portal is pushed to thousands of portable POS devices that then return data - both synchronously and asynchronously - back to the Portal for processing.
						</p><p class="abstract">
						I joined the project mid-way through to help speed up API requirements. I quickly inherited the role of BA and UX manager as well as primary driver of overall requirements and design.	The scope and ambition of the project demanded thorough analysis and a multitude of concurrent work streams.</p>
						<ul class="list-job">
							<li>Stabilized development by co-leading discovery meetings with the Architect to map functional and system dependencies previously unidentified. These sessions realigned the entire team, focusing efforts on foundational features and allowing important architectural decisions to be made quickly.</li>
							<explanation>The team felt disenfranchised and were left with the feeling that their concerns and suggestions were second tier. I was able to encourage their activity by involving them earlier in challenging requirements and bringing their input to senior team members making decisions. Ultimately, this led to more interactions and adhoc discussions throughout the team and, thus, improved sprints</explanation></li>
							<li>Foresaw and mitigated the risks of complex requirements by increasing the direct participation of developers. Previously left disenfranchised and unheard, Sprint health recovered dramatically after empowering developers to ask questions and provide suggestions to decision makers.
							<li>Managed internal and client BAs as well as an offshore Interaction Designer; elevated the team's ability to estimate, track, and complete work by introducing Trello</li>
							<li>Increased Requirements output and quality by introducing an API Functional Spec template based on developer feedback. <explanation>Having addressed the needs of the entire team, the template emphasised completeness and clarity. This centralised the information available to the team which in turn reduced the time spent in meetings and answering isolated questions.</explanation></li>
							<li>Sped up requirements gathering by collaborating extremely closely with the Architect, Leads and the development team to advise and lead meetings with the Product Owner on technical solutions and appropriate UX</li>

						<p class="abstract">An enterprise, web-based document composition and content management platform.

These efforts exposed large technical debts as well as the need for major feature enhancements.</p>
						<ul class="list-job">
							<li>Led feature/story generation and prioritization; involved combining inputs from three separate user bases as well multiple in-house stakeholders</li>
							<li>Served as primary contact for new customers. Evolving needs were captured, analyzed, and prioritized within the context of the Product's Roadmap. I incorporated my knowledge of their business, the product's long-term vision, and user experience to drive the planning and successful delivery of enhancements.</li>
							<li>Quickly ramped up as a SME leading customer training and requirement gathering after the first month alongside two client BAs</li>
							<li>Oversaw reduction of technical debt allowing for scalability and reliability improvements by building strong relationships with Technical Leads to smartly targeting high-value defects</li>
							<li>Reduced testing efforts from days to hours by building dynamic test management documents to enable automation. These synced development and QA efforts by simplifying complex business rules, providing traceability, and highlighting bottlenecks.</li>
							<li>Improved QA turn around and overall team efficiency by designing and implementing new JIRA workflows and screens</li>
							<li>Co-lead Agile ceremonies with Onshore, Chennai, and Bangalore teams. Actively improved the communication across 3 time zones</li>
