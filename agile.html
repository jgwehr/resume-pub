						<p class="abstract">A modernization project that brought enhanced user experience and OpenAPI to an immensely complex back-office portal application. Multiple clients and users are allowed to manage 20+ large sub-systems including Scheduling, Inventory, Reporting, Transactions, and various object profiles. Each feature involves shared business rules, integrations, and dependencies on other systems and external, out-of-band data. Work done in the Portal is pushed to thousands of portable POS devices that then return data - both synchronously and asynchronously - back to the Portal for processing.
						</p><p class="abstract">
						I joined the project mid-way through to help speed up API requirements. I quickly inherited the role of BA and UX manager as well as primary driver of overall requirements and design.
